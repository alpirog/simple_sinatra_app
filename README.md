# Simple Sinatra App

This app is written with Ruby programming language using Sinatra framework.
It serves only for educational purposes and is far from a complete application.

No database yet, no user authentication.
It may be updated in future, but may be not as well.

As for a style, the Bulma CSS framework (basically, only its CSS file) is being used.

Feel free to do whatever you want with this.

## Instructions

```
in your web browser.
