# Simple Sinatra App

This app is written with Ruby programming language using Sinatra framework.
It serves only for my own purposes and is far from a complete application.

However, you can calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI) and Daily Calories Expenditure, also known as TDEE.
So it may be handy if somehow you didn't find something similar yet.

## Features :)

No database, no user authentication.
It may be updated in future, but may be not as well.

As for a style, the Bulma CSS framework (basically, only its CSS file) is being used.

Feel free to do whatever you want with this.

## Instructions

Clone the repository to your local folder.
Run the following:

```
bundle install
rackup
```
or
```
bundle exec rackup
```
Go to //localhost:9292 in your web browser or other port if its specified after ```rackup``` command.
